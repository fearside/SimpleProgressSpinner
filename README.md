1. Information
This spinner styled progress indicator works when you are able to update/execute the spinner in your iteration/forloop/while case.

2. Usage
Import the function, start/update the spinner with:
Spinner

This must be done for every loop/process that have been made. This is to make a nice flow of updates on the screen.

3. Notice
Please note that all output from your application must be sent to ">> /dev/null 2>&1" so no output will interrupt the output from the spinner.
